Batch34 - Capstone Project : MUSIC RECOMMENDER SYSTEM WITH SENTIMENT ANALYSIS  
The purpose of this project is to create a music recommendation system that
classifies the emotions conveyed in Twitter user tweets using machine learning and
natural language processing techniques, and then uses a hybrid content-based and
collaborative filtering approach to suggest appropriate music.
The project mines user tweets for useful features using cutting-edge methods
including term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), GloVe
embeddings, and Universal Sentence Encoder . After that, a deep convolutional
neural network uses these features as input to classify emotions. The DCNN learns
to categorize tweets into several emotion categories, such as joy, sadness, rage, etc.,
using a labeled dataset of tweets annotated with emotion labels. Once the emotions
have been identified, the project uses a hybrid strategy that blends collaborative
filtering with content-based recommendation to produce tailored music
recommendations using the emotional context that was retrieved from tweets.
The proposed strategy is tested in the project using a sizable dataset of tweets and
music data, and the findings indicate promising gains in music recommendation
accuracy when compared to conventional approaches. By adding the emotional
context of user tweets, the suggested methodology has the potential to improve the
user experience of music recommendation systems. It also makes a contribution to
the fields of NLP and machine learning by investigating cutting-edge methods for
music recommendation utilizing social media data.
